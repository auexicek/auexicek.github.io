        <h1>Fake Copycat sites</h1>

        <p>Unfortunately, one of my classmates copied my website. He thinks that it would be funny to copy my site, replace my name everywhere (eve in icons), and then not credit me.</p>
        <p>I have added a license to my site's root directory, but nothing in the copycat site changed, except know he's claiming authorship of the site.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, he can't alter the source of my PICO-8 projects, so they still show my name.</p>
        <p>I have considered changing the entire site into a PICO-8 project, so that people couldn't copy and alter my site.</p>
        <p>But, I don't want to do that immeadiately, so until that has to happen, I'll try to make his site less believable, because I have proof that it is fake.</p>
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://mondeon.dev/important/proof.png" alt="" class="title1" width="75%">
        <br>
        <p>To prove, that my site isn't fake, you can see my "deployments" site. Unfortunately, I found out that people that aren't in my github account, you can't see my commits to the project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But, my classmate's version isn't availible on GitHub, so what other proof I have? Well, i'll tell you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a chance, that you have heard of the "WayBack machine" on archive.org.</p>
        <p>Well, this site tries to archive as many sites, as it can. But smaller pages get archived less often.</p>
        <p>So, here comes the argument: my site already has been archived twice. First time way back in 2022. The copycat hasn't been archived even once.</p>
        <p>To let people reading this see, how far the copycat tried to get, you can click <a href="https://games.kmaster.ovh/">here</a> to see the Copycat site.</p>
        <p>You can see, that it would be really convincing.</p>
        <p>I have one major problem with this:</p>
        <p>My classmate left the photo of my cat, Zuza on the site.</p>
        <p>Well, my cat has been missing for over 2 months.</p>
        <p>I hope Daniel credits me in his fake site, or AT LEAST deletes his weird "copyright", because he has none. And maybe, he could even make the site less fake, and just use it as a template for his own site.</p>
        <p>If nothing changes, I'll be looking forward for Picotron even more.</p>
        <p>There could also be other signs, like sketchy URLs, or even (as I found out right now at 19:28 11th of October 2023), the logo on my site has a transparent background, when the Copycat doesn't.</p>
        <p>There are also other things, like his itch.io page has only recently been created, with currently zero games, with his "PICO-8" page (copied from me) says that he's working on some game jams.</p>
